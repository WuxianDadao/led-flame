# led-flame

Ardunino ESP32 code for a DMX (sACN/E1.31)-controlled LED flame bulb.

This code was developed to take a non-intelligent/non-controllable Omicoo LED
Flame Effect Light Bulb ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BPYTZD5/ref=twister_B07VKL9H99))
and replace its controller by an [Arduino ESP32 (Huzzah32)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
board, making the flame controllable via DMX.
